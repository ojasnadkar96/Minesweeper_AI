# Minesweeper AI

This project was implemented as a part of Artifical Intelligence (CS271P) course at University of California, Irvine

The agent can solve:<br>
80% Beginner worlds (8X8 10 mines)<br>
70% Intermediate worlds (16X16 40 mines)<br>
23% Expert worlds (16X30 99 mines)<br>

## Generating the worlds

Open 'WorldGenertor' and run the 'generateTournament.sh' to generate 1000 worlds of each level.<br>
<br>
The worlds are generated in a 'Problems' folder which is created once the shell script is run.<br>
<br>
